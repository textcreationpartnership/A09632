            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For himſelfe ſayth, that after the account of the Hebrues, it is but 1656. &amp; ſo the ſeuerall yeres of the fathers which himſelf a little before did ſet down, doe amount to the ſame total ſumme of 1656. though he miſſe in ſome particulars, adding to <hi>Adam</hi> 20. yeres which he taketh from <hi>Iered:</hi> and to <hi>Seth</hi> 25. which he taketh from <hi>Mahaleel.</hi> Yet the Lxx. Greeke Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters are wider off than he. For they reckon to the end of the Deluge, 2362. which is more than <hi>Euſebius</hi> by 120. but that totall of 2242. which <hi>Euſebius</hi> hath, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with the Latine Tranſlation of the lxx.

betweene the Deluge and <hi>Terahs</hi> ſeuentie one yeare; (which he after the common opinion, ſuppoſeth to be the firſt yeare of <hi>Abraham</hi>) he ſaith, there are 720. yeares: which ſumme is ſurely corrupted &amp; falſefied. For in the body of his Chronicle, he maketh <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> firſt to be the yeare of the world 3185. &amp; vpon that ground proceedeth in all his Chronicle, whereby it is euident that he maketh betweene the Deluge and <hi>Abrahams</hi> birth 942. yet the ſeuerall ſummes of the fathers ages, which he ſetteth downe before, amount to 1082. which ſum the lxx. make betweene the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge and <hi>Terahs</hi> ſeuentie one yeare, wanting but 10. yeres, which <hi>Euſebius</hi> putteth to <hi>Nahor</hi> more than the lxx. did, and thoſe 10. yeares he ſtroke out in the ſum, wherby he proceedeth in his Chronicle: as alſo 130. which both he and they giue to one <hi>Cainan:</hi> becauſe in the Hebrue there is no ſuch man as <hi>Cainan.</hi> And then there remaine the foreſaide 942. which is too much by 650. as himſelfe intimateth in the 51. yeare of <hi>Abraham,</hi> affirming that vnto that yeare the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues account but 2000 yeares. The cauſe of this Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſſage is in the lxx. Interpreters whome herein hee followeth who to make the yeares of the Fathers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Deluge ſomewhat proportionable to thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Deluge, giue to all the Fathers betweene <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Nahor</hi> 100. yeares a peece, and to <hi>Nahor</hi> 50. more than the Hebrue hath, and ſo likewiſe before the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge the lxx. gaue to <hi>Adam</hi> 200. to <hi>Lemech</hi> 6. &amp; to al the reſt, that wer not in their hundredths 100. a peece.</p>
            <p>This Computatiton of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> coupling <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> firſt with the 3185. of the world, is vſed by many, as <hi>Origen, Epiphanius, Cedrenus, Nicephorus &amp;c.</hi> and by

the Greeke church, &amp; Eaſt Empire euen at the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of <hi>Baſill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The time of <hi>Terahs</hi> age, when hee begatte <hi>Abraham,</hi> is alſo controuerſed. For the Hebrues ſay, that <hi>Terah</hi> begat <hi>Abraham,</hi> when hee was 70. yeare old, and ſo begin <hi>Abrahams</hi> firſt with <hi>Terahs</hi> 71. whom all Greekes and almoſt Latines follow. For which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion theſe reaſons may be giuen. Firſt <hi>Moſes Gen. 11.26.</hi> expreſſeth the 70. yeare of <hi>Terah,</hi> and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth next to it the name of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by whom the Computation was to be continued: <hi>and</hi> Terah <hi>liued 70. yeares and begat</hi> Abraham, Nahor <hi>and</hi> Haran. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe that yeare 130. (at which age by this account <hi>Terah</hi> ſhould beget <hi>Abraham</hi>) is no where expreſſed by <hi>Moſes:</hi> So that whereas all the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes haue their ages recorded, only <hi>Abraham,</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all the faithfull, euen the Archpatriarke, hath his omitted: and his age in other yeares is fiue times ſet downe: which were all great abſurdities. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>ab Analogia:</hi> becauſe after the Deluge moſt of the Fathers begat about the age of 30. onely <hi>Terah</hi> at 130. Fourthly, becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelfe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth that he ſhould haue a ſonne at 100, yeare olde: which were no wonder if hee were begotten when his father was 130. yeare old.</p>
            <p>All this is counterpeſed by the onelie authoritie of Saint <hi>Stephen, Act. 7.4.</hi> who plainelie affirmeth, that <hi>Abraham</hi> abode at <hi>Haran</hi> till his Father <hi>Terah</hi> was dead: and <hi>Moſes</hi> recordeth <hi>Gen. 11.32.</hi> that <hi>Terah</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when he was 205. yeare old, &amp; that <hi>Abraham</hi> then preſently departing from <hi>Haran</hi> was 75. yere old <hi>Gen. 12.1.4.</hi> which beeing ſubducted out of 205. there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:15194:10"/>
130. which was <hi>Terahs</hi> age when he begat <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram.</hi> And this is plaine by the very text of <hi>Moſes,</hi> if by the deuiding of the chapter, the ſence and matter were not ſomewhat broken in ſight and disioynted. For thus it hangeth together: <hi>And the daies of</hi> Terah <hi>were 205. yeares, and</hi> Terah <hi>died in</hi> Haran. <hi>For God had ſaid to</hi> Abraham: <hi>Get thee out of thy country, and from thy natiue ſoyle, and from thy fathers houſe, vnto the land that I will ſhew thee: and I will make of thee a great Nation, and will bleſſe thee, and make thy name great: and thou ſhalt be a bleſſing. I will alſo bleſſe them that bleſſe thee, and curſe them that curſe thee: and in thee ſhall all the families of the earth bee bleſſed. And</hi> Abram <hi>departed, euen as the Lord ſpake vnto him; and</hi> Lot <hi>went with him, and</hi> Abram <hi>was 75. yeare old when he departed out of</hi> Haran. What can bee ſpoken more plainely, to ſhew that <hi>Abram</hi> was 75. yeare old, when his Father was 205. yeare old: and therefore his father 130. yeares elder than hee? Doth not <hi>Moſes</hi> ſay expreſſely; that <hi>Terah</hi> died when he was 205. yeare old: and then God ſaid to <hi>Abram,</hi> Goe out of thy Country: and <hi>Abram</hi> anon as God had ſpoken, departed, being then 75. yeare old; and this is the very firſt time that <hi>Abrahams</hi> age is ſpoken of by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſeruing onely to ſhewe at what yeare of <hi>Terahs</hi> age he was borne.</p>
            <p>Of the obiections alleaged, the firſt is infringed by <hi>Geneſis 5.33. And</hi> Noah <hi>was fiue hundred yeares old, and</hi> Noah <hi>begat</hi> Sem, Cham, <hi>and</hi> Iaphet. Where in the very ſame ſort, <hi>Noahs</hi> 500. yeare is expreſſed, &amp; the name of <hi>Sem,</hi> by whom the Computation was to be continued, ioyned next with it: and yet it is plaine by <hi>Gen. 11.10.</hi> that <hi>Sem</hi> was begotten two yeares after, as <hi>Funccius</hi> himſelfe proueth. And alſo by <hi>1. Paral. 1.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:15194:10"/>
28.</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>The ſonnes of</hi> Abraham <hi>were</hi> Iſaak <hi>and</hi> Iſmael, and yet no man will ſay, that <hi>Iſaak</hi> was the elder. The reaſon of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in thoſe places may be the excellencie of the Perſons, in regard that the <hi>Mesſias</hi> ſhould deſcend of them. Secondly the abſurdities are all auoided: becauſe by the coupling of <hi>Terahs</hi> 205. yeare, with <hi>Abrams</hi> 75. yeare, <hi>Abrahams</hi> natiuitie is moſt certaine. Thirdly, the proportion which is pretended, was in the firſt-borne. For doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les the other Fathers had their laſt children at a farre greater age; and perhaps <hi>Haran</hi> was borne, when <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> was 70. yeare old, for that he was farre elder than <hi>Nahor,</hi> appeareth verſe 29. in that hee had a daughter mariageable for <hi>Nahor;</hi> and alſo elder than <hi>Abram</hi> the Iewes doe inferre, holding that his daughter <hi>Iſcha,</hi> was <hi>Sara Abrams</hi> wife being but ten yeare yonger than <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſheweth. Howſoeuer it be, that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is of no force: for there was a greater diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and oddes between <hi>Noach</hi> and the other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers before him, and euery man ſeeth that the miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of that ground cauſed the lxx. and <hi>Euſebius</hi> to miſſe their footing ſo much in the yeares of the other Fathers. Fourthly the cauſe of <hi>Abrahams</hi> admiration was <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>For the defence of <hi>Wolphius</hi> account this may be ſaide. God threatneth the wandring of 40 yeares in the wildernes after the returne of the Spies: and that

            <p>The end of the bearing of this burden and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing of the iniquitie, is both plainely expreſſed, and alſo typically repreſented to be the beſieging of the Citie <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> yet not the beſieging ſimply (for at the beginning of the ſiege they were in caſe good enough, feeling no puniſhment at all:) but that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, when as by reaſon of the ſiege the Citie grewe to be in harde termes, and extreeme famine,

The Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was taken in the ninth day of the fourth month of the yeare 3416. which is from the 15. day of the eight month of the yeare 3025. being <hi>Ieroboams</hi> firſt yeare, 390 yeares complete; beſide the three monthes and fifteene daies of 3025. which muſt goe to make vp <hi>Ieroboams</hi> firſt yeare, which was wholly numbred in the article before; and alſo beſide the three monthes and nine daies of 3416. which muſt goe likewiſe to make vp the firſt yeare of the captiuitie; and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be reckoned in the next article.

Both theſe accounts, aſwel of the 40. years of <hi>Iudaes</hi> iniquity &amp; of the 390. of <hi>Iſraels</hi> iniquitie are confirmed to the eie in the chronological table of the kings of <hi>Iudae</hi> &amp; <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

And they ended in the ninth day and fourth month of 3486. and immediatly after it ſeemeth that <hi>Babilon</hi> was taken, and the king ſlaine, as <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Xenophon</hi> report. <hi>Hierome</hi> in his expoſition vpon <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niell</hi> reporteth that the Iewes had a tale among them that <hi>Baltaſſar,</hi> ſeeing the 70. yeares expired, thought the promiſe falſe, and all cock ſure; and therfore vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a iollitie, and vaunting ouer the Iewes, made his great banquet, and ſent for all the veſſels of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſheweth. But the ſame night he was ſlaine and the promiſe fulfilled.

To <hi>Daniel</hi> the Angel ſpeaketh of a word or Edict, that hath two branches: the firſt <hi>to bring againe the people:</hi> the other <hi>to build the Citie of</hi> Ieruſalem; both which <hi>Eſdras</hi> had; but <hi>Nehemias</hi> wanted the one, and <hi>Zoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel</hi> wanted the other. Wherefore conſidering the euidencie of <hi>Daniels</hi> prophecie &amp; the Angels ſpeech, and waighing withall the wonderfull concent &amp; har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the beſt approued humane writers with this Computation (which after will appeare) it cannot be but cleare and manifeſt to all men, that <hi>Daniels</hi> weeks begin neyther at the one, nor at the other of them:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:15194:33"/>
though many learned men haue made the beginning thereof at each of them. As: at <hi>Nehemias</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in <hi>Longimans</hi> 20 yeare the common expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beginneth <hi>Daniels</hi> 70 weekes: whom very many great Clarkes followe, as <hi>Beda, Petrus Galatinus:</hi> and of late <hi>Lucidus Samotheus,</hi> and <hi>Clemens Schubertus &amp;c.</hi> But as that is taken, it differeth not in time from our account. For they make it the 20 yeare, not of his ſole raigne after his father, but from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his raign, while his father liued: the 20 yeare whereof was but the 7 of his ſole raigne, which I rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon of.

But that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the word, which the Angell ment: becauſe the Angell poynteth out, deſcribeth, and from all other words diſtinguiſheth the word that he ment, by two notable &amp; euident markes and ſignes: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it ſhould be the going forth of a word <hi>to bring againe the people, and to builde</hi> Ieruſalem. Wheras the commiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which <hi>Zorobabel</hi> receiued at that time, and

was proclaymed in all <hi>Cyrus</hi> kingdom, had not a word of building <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> or of ordayning any ſtate and common wealth there:<note place="margin">Ezr. 1.2.</note> but onely to <hi>build the houſe of the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>which is at</hi> Ieruſalem. For that was the thing that <hi>Cyrus</hi> reſpected, euen the ſeruing of God,<note place="margin">3</note> and ſacrificing to God in that houſe: and therefore permitteth them of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that will buylde it, to goe to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and to builde the houſe:<note place="margin">4</note> and the reſidue, in what countrey ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they abide, to helpe them that goe, with their contribution towarde the building vp of that houſe of God in <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> whereof the Angel ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not one word. It may be, that moſt ſpitefull Iew, <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> wanting not wit but grace (as one ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of him) ſought by this ſleight to bring the Goſpel into diſcredit and diſgrace among other nations and to alienate them from it: when they ſhould ſee Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to proue that Chriſt was incarnate and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his due time, corſſe and contradict the Hiſtorie and Chronologie of all other nations and times; and the recordes of all ſtates and Empyres. As to the like end, that is, to obſcure &amp; ouerſhadow the time &amp; truth of Chrrſt, his fellow <hi>Rabbi Solomon,</hi> beginneth <hi>Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els</hi> weekes at the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> by <hi>Nabucho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donoſor,</hi> &amp; endeth them at the deſtruction of the ſame by <hi>Veſpaſian.</hi> It is a very hell to them, to ſee the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes of the Monarchies beare reccord to Chriſt; or the annales, actes, and hiſtories of other kingdoms and people appeare as witneſſes, that Chriſt was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and exhibited in the fulneſſe of time, that God ſo long before had ſet and ſhewed by his Prophets. And this vſe we are to make of humane writers and Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niclers,

though heatheniſh; euen to make them ſerue vnto Chriſt, toward the leading of vs into an vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the trueth of times and ſeaſons: ſince the holy Ghoſt doth not refuſe the ſame neyther in the olde, nor new Teſtament: leading vs to the better and readier knowledge of the old times by the yeares and account of <hi>Nabuchodonoſor:</hi> and of the new times of our Sauiour himſelfe, by the time of <hi>Auguſtus, Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Cyrenius, Pilat, &amp;c.</hi> Wherof we ſhall make ſmall vſe, if we be barred from humane writings &amp; records. The ende of theſe 70 weekes is the Paſſion of Chriſt, as is euident, <hi>verſ. 24. &amp; 26.</hi> Yet the authors of the former opinion, which begin them at <hi>Longimans</hi> 20. yeare, and <hi>Tremellius</hi> for the other, end the 70 weekes three yeares and a halfe after Chriſt; beginning the laſt weeke, wherein the Teſtament ſhould be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to many, at Chriſtes baptiſme, and ending halfe of it at his paſsion, reſeruing the other halfe to his Apoſtles for the accompliſhment of the worke: or as though the Angell had vſed <hi>numero rotundo pro corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> the full and round number for the broken, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the odde three yeares and halfe, that were wanting of the full ſumme.

            <p>And for the further confirmation of this Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, it doth heereby appeare moſt clearely, that the birth of Chriſt is rightly and iuſtly placed in the 751 yeare of <hi>Rome</hi> after <hi>Dionyſius</hi> account; and alſo in the 4020 yeare of the world.

               <hi>September:</hi> adde thereto 42, and there will be 751, in which yeare Chriſt was borne. Now for the yeare of the world, it appeared before that <hi>Dionyſius</hi> began the Computation of the yeares of <hi>Rome</hi> with the 7. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> which was about the ſommer ſolſtice of the yeare of the world 3270, which taketh vp the firſt yeare of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the 7 <hi>Olympiad</hi> all ſaue one quarter. Wherefore to 3269 and a quarter adde 709, and a quarter (that is from the ſommer ſolſtice to the 22 of <hi>September:</hi>) and then 41 of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (from the 22 of <hi>September</hi> to the 25 of <hi>December:</hi>) and there will amount 4019 yeares and three quarters to the Natiuitie of Chriſt. And heere it ſhall not be amiſſe to note the harmonie, and agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Paterculus</hi> and other ancient and autentique writers in this poynt. <hi>Paterculus</hi> giueth for a note worth the remembrance, that the ſaid 10 Calendes of <hi>October,</hi> or the 22 day of <hi>September,</hi> was a day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was full 20 yeare old, <hi>pridie quàm vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginti annos impleret.</hi> And firſt for the day <hi>Suetonius</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth, affirming <hi>Cap. 5.</hi> that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was borne 9 Cal. <hi>Octobris,</hi> or 23 day of <hi>September.</hi> Secondly for the yeare, it may be gathered thus: <hi>Florus</hi> and <hi>Eutro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi> affirme, that when <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> was ſlaine, <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> was 18 yeare olde: whereto we muſt adde as much as from the 23 of <hi>September</hi> to the Ides or 15 day of <hi>March,</hi> on which day <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> was ſlaine. After his death <hi>Antonius</hi> and <hi>Dolobella</hi> being Conſuls tooke the authoritie vpon them til <hi>Ianuarie</hi> following, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Hirtius</hi> and <hi>Panſa</hi> were created Conſuls: who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward were ſlaine at <hi>Mutina:</hi> and the 10 Cal. of <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober</hi> next after their death <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:15194:41"/>
and the morrow after (as you ſee) was iuſt 20 yeare old. So that from <hi>Iulius Caeſars</hi> death to <hi>Auguſtus</hi> Conſulſhip was about a yeare and halfe. Which agreeth likewiſe with the account of <hi>Paterculus.</hi> For Eutropius ſaith, that <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> was ſlaine <hi>anno ab vrbe condita ſeptingenteſimo ferè ac nono: In the yeare after the building of</hi> Rome <hi>ſeuen hundred and almoſt nine.</hi> He addeth <hi>almoſt,</hi> becauſe the ſeuen hundreth and ninth yeare was not fully complet by his account and <hi>Varroes</hi> (indeede not begun by <hi>Dionyſius</hi> account:) and the 22 of <hi>September</hi> tweluemonth after <hi>Auguſtus</hi> Conſulſhip began: ſo that as <hi>Paterculus</hi> ſaith, 709 yeares after the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> were fully complet before <hi>Auguſtus</hi> Conſulſhip, and as much as from the ſommer ſolſtice to the 22 of <hi>September.</hi> And whereas <hi>Solinus, Cap. 2.</hi> ſaith that <hi>Hirtius</hi> &amp; <hi>Panſa</hi> were Conſuls in the 710 yeare of <hi>Rome,</hi> he muſt not be taken, as though their creation were in the yeare 710; but that the 710 began about the middle of the yeare of their Conſulſhip: or elſe that therein he followeth the Computation of <hi>Varro,</hi> and not of <hi>Dionyſius.</hi> But he is greatly ouerſeene in the ſame place, auouching that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was created Conſul, <hi>decimum octauum annum agens, being in his 18 yeare.</hi> Contrarie to <hi>Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus,</hi> as you heard before; and to <hi>Suetonius</hi> likewiſe, who ſaith <hi>Conſulatum vigeſimo aetatis anno inuaſit: He forcibly tooke the Conſulſhip, in the twentith yeare of his age.</hi>

            <p>AT this day all Chriſtendome vſeth to make their accountes &amp; Computations by the years of Chriſt. And yet notwithſtanding preſently after Chriſt that Computation was not vſed: but the common order of accounting and dating was by the Conſuls of <hi>Rome:</hi> ſauing that the Church had a particular Aera or Computation of their owne, which began 38 yeares before Chriſt: and ſome kingdomes accounted by the raignes of their owne kinges; all which are ſeene by the dates in the Tomes of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> vſed a Computation from the paſsion of Chriſt, as <hi>Beda</hi> ſheweth, <hi>li. de nat. rerum.

Marry now the <hi>Turkes</hi> vſe their Computation which they call <hi>Alhigera,</hi> beginning in the yeare of Chriſt 622: and the <hi>Perſians</hi> vſe their <hi>Ieſdagert,</hi> which began in the yeare of Chriſt 632. But in the yeare of Chriſt 532 <hi>Dionyſius Exiguus</hi> inſtituting the Paſchal Cicle, and Golden number, would not number and calculate the ſame by the Aera or Computation of wicked <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletian</hi> the 10. perſecutor of the Church, which then was vſed thorow the whole Empyre, but would caſt and account it by the yeares of Chriſt, beginning at his Incarnation, as <hi>Beda</hi> ſheweth <hi>Tom. 2 li. de nat. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. cap. 46.</hi> Which Aera or Computation was not vſed by the Emperors or Popes till long after. For the firſt Emperour that vſed it in dating of his Actes, proceedings, &amp; Epiſtles, was <hi>Carolus Craſſus.</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward <hi>Eugenius</hi> IIII. at the aduiſe &amp; inſtance of <hi>Blon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> his Regiſter receiued it into the Popes Bulles and writtes: as <hi>Paulus Foroſempronienſis</hi> affirmeth in his <hi>Paulina parte 2. li. 13.

Clarke of the Popes counſell, this Computation of yeares from the Incarnation of Christ began firſt to be written in the Popes Bulles and Mandates.</hi> Which I doe not take, as though the Computation by the yeares of the Lord was then firſt brought into the Church (as <hi>Gerardus, Mercator</hi> and other take it,) or as though it were not vſed in the actes of the Church, and in eccleſiaſticall courtes and proceedings before that time; but that then and by that meanes it began firſt to be vſed in the Bulles, Mandates, and writtes, that were meere <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal,</hi> and paſſed onely from the Pope. For in writtes of that nature, the yeare of the Lord was not mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at al before that time, but onely the yeares of their owne coronation, <hi>anno Pontificatus noſtri, &amp;c.</hi> For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none after <hi>Paulus Foroſempronienſis</hi> addeth: <hi>Sed notarij annos à natiuitate computare conſueuerunt.

The order whereof I will briefly ſet downe. The computation from the Incarnation of Chriſt, ordained by <hi>Dionyſius</hi> was vſed till <hi>Decem. 25. 1351.</hi> At which time for ſpeciall cauſe, which is ſhewed, pag. <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

               </gap> it was decreed, that the computatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the yeare of the Lord, ſhould begin, not at the Incarnation or 25 of <hi>March</hi> (as before it did,) but at the Natiuitie or <hi>25</hi> of <hi>December:</hi> and yet the ſame number ſhould be kept and obſerued without alteration all the yeare

thorow, ſaue the firſt quarter. Forſomuch they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented the change and beginning of the new yeare, writing 1352. after the ſaid 25. of <hi>December,</hi> which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they ſhould not haue done till the Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or <hi>25.</hi> day of <hi>March</hi> following. The Act or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree is recorded by <hi>Ierapha: His quoque temporibus apud Perpinianum oppidum in curia generali 25 Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris 1351 fuit determinatum in Catalonia, ne Calendae à notarijs in chartis ſcriberentur, nec ab Incarnatione annus Domini, ſed à Natiuitate inchoaretur. And alſo at that time, at</hi> Parpinnan <hi>in a generall Court,</hi> Decemb. <hi>25. 1351. it was decreed in</hi> Catalonia, <hi>that the Calendes ſhould not be vſed by Notaries in Chartes, and that the year of the Lord ſhould not begin at the incarnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but at the Natiuitie.</hi> The practiſe hereof appeareth in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Conſtance</hi> about 53 yeares after: where all the Seſſions and Actes are dated, not by Calendes, but by the daies of the month, and by the yeares from the Natiuitie of the Lord, and not from his incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Which yeare did alter &amp; chaunge not at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation: for the ſecond ſeſſion holden the ſecond of <hi>March,</hi> and the third holden the <hi>25.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> that is the day of Chriſtes Incarnation; and the fourth holden the 30. of <hi>March;</hi> and the fift, holden the 6. of <hi>Aprill,</hi> are all recorded in one and the ſame yeare 1415. But the yeare altered and changed vpon the verie day of the Natiuitie. For the coronation of <hi>Martin V.</hi> is recorded to be vpon ſunday the 21. day of <hi>Nouember anno à Natiuitate Domini 1417. Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione 10.</hi> and vpon tueſday the 28 of <hi>December</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was holden the 42 Seſſion, and there the yeare is altered both of the yeare of the Lord and alſo of the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:15194:44"/>
Indiction. For it is dated <hi>anno a Natiuitate Domini 1418. indictione 11.</hi> Indeed printed copies haue there alſo 1417. but an auncient copie written by a Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie at the very councell (which <hi>Lucidus Samotheus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that he hath ſeene) hath 1418. And it muſt needes be ſo: firſt becauſe the yeare of the Lord is there expreſſed, which would not haue beene done vnleſſe the yeare were chaunged. For otherwiſe he would haue ſaid, <hi>anno &amp; indictione quibus ſuprà.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly becauſe the 22. and 29. of <hi>April</hi> following, are there recorded, <hi>anno &amp; indictione quibus ſuprà.</hi> And the next before mentioned is that: whereas in <hi>April</hi> 1417 the 32 Seſſion was held, as before there was mentioned. Thirdly becauſe the Indiction is changed: which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> altereth with their yeare.</p>
            <p>But in all that Councel the writtes and proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Popes themſelues, <hi>Martin v. Gregorie xij</hi> or <hi>Iohn xxiiij.</hi> are dated neither by the daies of the month nor by the yeare of the Lord, but by the Calendes &amp; the yeare of their owne Papacie or Coronation. And I haue a pardon granted by <hi>Martin V.</hi> to <hi>Iſſabell Woot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> of London dated thus: <hi>vi. Idus Martij, Pontificatus noſtri anno nono,</hi> without any mention of the yeare of the Lord. Wherefore <hi>Blondus</hi> perſwading <hi>Eugenius</hi> IIII. about thirtie yeares after that councell, to date his Bulles Pardons and writtes by the yeare of the Lord, would haue him to follow <hi>Dionyſius</hi> ſtile, and to write from the Incarnation, keeping the ſame number, but altering the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> or marke: though all other courtes and notaries did keepe their newe ſtile from the Natiuitie; as <hi>Forocempronienſis</hi> affirmed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

The practiſe heereof is euident in the councell of <hi>Baſil,</hi> held vnder the ſame <hi>Eugenius,</hi> wherein all his Bulles and Mandates, as alſo the Bull of <hi>Nicholaus V.</hi> are dated, <hi>anno Incarnationis Dominicae, &amp;c.</hi> and by the Calendes. And the reuocation of three of his Buls is dated by himſelfe <hi>Calendis Ianuarij, anno Incarnatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Dominicae 1433:</hi> but the Biſhop and two Cardinals which ſubſcribed to the ſame Reuocation, the fift day of <hi>Februarie</hi> following, date their ſubſcription <hi>anno a Natiuitate Domini 1434.</hi> where the yeare, you ſee, is chaunged. And ſo all the Seſsions and Actes of the ſame councell are dated by the yeare <hi>à Natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Domini.</hi> or <hi>anno Domini,</hi> which is all one: for they meane <hi>à Natiuitate.</hi> The like practiſe we haue in the Bull of <hi>Clement VII.</hi> for the Iubilie 1525. For the Bull, as it came from the Pope himſelfe, is dated thus: <hi>Datum Romae apud ſanctum Petrum, anno Incarnationis Dominicae 1524. Cal. Maij.</hi> But out of the courte of <hi>Audience</hi> by the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> Auditor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the Apoſtolique Chamber, it is dated thus: <hi>Datum Romae in aedibus noſtrae ſolitae reſidentiae, anno a Natiuitate Domini 1524. die decimo menſis Iunij.</hi> And theſe are the two vſuall datings and computations in Chriſtendome at this day: the occaſion of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence whereof I will briefly ſhew. The principall cauſe of the oddes and errour was in <hi>Dionyſius Exigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us;</hi> who both erred himſelfe, and cauſed other to erre, as one ſaide truely of him; though the ſame man could not find out the errour: as in like ſort, <hi>Reinerius, Sigebertus Gemblacenſis, Stofflerinus, Paulus Foroſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pronienſis, &amp;c.</hi> haue found by their Calculations, that <hi>Dionyſius</hi> was out and in an errour: Marry wherein
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:15194:45"/>
the errour conſiſteth, and what was the true cauſe thereof, which being taken away, it might be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and made right, they coulde not perceiue: and therefore miſtaking the cauſe, they plunge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into further errours. The trueth is briefly this: <hi>Dionyſius</hi> intending principally the time and account to come, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> onely the time and Computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on paſt, came too ſhort of the Conception or Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Chriſt by one whole yeare, in his account backward; becauſe he accounted from the Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt to his Paſsion but onely 33 yeares &amp; ſo made the whol life of Chriſt but onely 32 yeares; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the odde time from the 25 of <hi>December</hi> to his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. In which errour were (as <hi>Foroſempronienſis</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koneth them vp <hi>parte 2. li. 4.)

For if Chriſt began not to preach till the beginning of the ſpring, as <hi>Clemens Romanus Recog. 1. Pa.</hi> 2. affirmeth, then he preached not much aboue three yeares. But how long it was after his Baptiſme before he beganne to preach, the Euangeliſtes doe not ſhewe, neyther ſaith <hi>Ignatius</hi> any thing of that ſpace: but that he
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:15194:47"/>
preached ful three yeares. Wherfore to conclude, the time of the life, of Chriſt from his Natiuitie to his Paſsion, was 33 yeares and a quarter: and from his Conception or Incarnation to his Paſsion, was full 34 yeares.</p>

More argumentes and teſtimonies might be alleaged for proofe heereof, were it not confeſſed by <hi>Dionyſius</hi> his followers, that they all make but 33 yeares from Chriſtes Incarnation to his Paſsion. Which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward being perceiued, cauſed thoſe alterations of the yeare of the Lord, which I noted pag. <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

               </gap> , and the varietie of Computation which is vſed in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. For they which made the firſt alteration <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Domini</hi> 1351, being loth to alter the number, and to adde one yeare more to their vulgar and vſuall Computation, (which would breede by all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode too much inconuenience) they thought it better to keepe the ſame number, and firſt to alter the <hi>Epoche</hi> or marke, ſetting it ſhorter backe by three quarters of a yeare, and therefore decreed that it ſhould be accounted but from his Natiuitie: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to anticipate the change of the next newe yeare, beginning it ſooner by one quarter of a yeare. And by this means they both regained the whole laſt year, and alſo made the Computation of the yeare of the Lord to come within eight daies of the vſuall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> which began at the Calends of <hi>Ianuarie.</hi> But <hi>Blondus</hi> about 80 yeares after that, perſwading <hi>Eugenius</hi> IIII. that the Popes owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptes, Bulles, Actes, and proceſſes might alſo be dated by the yeare of the Lord, whether it were, for that he would of ſingularitie make the Pope differ e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in his Dates from the common courſe, or (which I thinke rather) for that he ſaw the newe ſtile and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count did not well concurre and agree, neither with
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:15194:48"/>
the naturall courſe of the yeare, which beginneth with the Spring, when the ſunne entereth into <hi>Aries,</hi> nor with the ordinance of God, which appoynted the month <hi>Abib</hi> for the firſt, nor with the ancient Computation of the Church, which began both the yeares of the world, and the yeare of the Lord at one time, <hi>viz.</hi> about the Vernall Aequinocticall,) refuſed the new ſtile and Computation from the Natiuitie, &amp; tooke the old from the Incarnation. Yet beginning the change of the new yeare after the new yeare of the other Computation from the Natiuitie (as euidently appeareth by the two dates of the Popes Reuocation in the councell of <hi>Baſil,</hi>) he intimateth not obſcurelie, that this his Computation reached not to the true Incarnation of Chriſt by one whole yeare, but that it beginneth at the feaſt of his Incarnation, which was in the firſt yeare of his Natiuitie, and ſo left out the whole laſt yeare before the beginning of his Computation.</p>
            <p>This Computation of <hi>Blondus</hi> is vſed by the church of <hi>England:</hi> and not onely heere, but alſo in <hi>Italy</hi> by the ſtates of <hi>Florence,</hi> and <hi>Sienes;</hi> all which vſe the Computation from the Incarnation, and begin the yeare the 25 day of <hi>March,</hi> after that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath begun their Computation from the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie the 25 of <hi>Dece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber</hi> before. As <hi>Anno Reginae</hi> 37, the 25 day of <hi>December,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> began the yeare 1595 from the Natiuitie: and the Citie of <hi>Rome</hi> together with the Aſtronomers (for they haue a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Computatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, proportioned to the ancient and vſual yeare of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> without any regard of the firſt 8 daies of Chriſtes Natiuitie) begin the ſame

yeare 1595 the firſt day of <hi>Ianuarie,</hi> or the feaſt of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, which therfore is called New-yeares day, as our yearly Almanacks ſhew: and at the 25 of <hi>March</hi> following, we of <hi>England, Florence,</hi> and <hi>Senes</hi> begin the ſame yeare 1595 from the Incarnation or Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt. Which is as much, as if Chriſt had beene borne and Circumciſed too, a quarter of a yeare before he was conceiued: were it not that they by this their Computation would giue vs to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that there is loſt a whole yeare of the Lord, which they would regaine and reſtore by beginning their Computation from his Incarnation a iuſt yeare after his true Incarnation: that is at the feaſt of his Incarnation or Annunciation next after his Natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. But the ſtates of <hi>Piſa</hi> haue the right and perfect computation from the Incarnation, which runneth alwaies a iuſt yeare before this of <hi>England, Florence,</hi> and <hi>Senes.</hi> For the ſame 25 of <hi>March Elizabethae</hi> 37 they begin the yeare 1596 from the Incarnation; and ſo date all their recordes, writtes, proceſſes, Epiſtles, euidences, &amp;c. Indeed in thoſe places, where anie of the other Computations are vſed, perhaps it will ſeeme good and conuenient, as not vnlikely it did to <hi>Blondus,</hi> not to alter their account and ſtile ancient though erroneus, but rather to keepe and retayne the vulgar and vſuall Computation, both in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique and priuate Actes, becauſe the alteration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would breede ſome confuſion in their recordes and euidences. But yet it is neceſſarie for the ſtudious in Hiſtorie to be acquainted heerewith, and to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the differences of Computations in the worlde.</p>
            <p>Of this poynt I haue beene the larger, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:15194:49"/>
the author of our laſt great Chronicle, in his deſcription of <hi>England. li. 3. ca. 14.</hi> maketh this a great ſcruple (to vſe his owne terme) and ſo leaueth it, concluding that <hi>with vs Chriſt is borne before he is conceiued:</hi> and partly becauſe I remember this doubt was moued to a man of manifolde learning, and of great reading and iudgement, as any in this land, who did anſwere it by a diſtinction of <hi>Annus Natiuitatis,</hi> and <hi>annus Actatis.</hi> Which diſtinction I haue read in <hi>Iacobus Phillippus Bergomenſis Chronic. li. 8.</hi> where he laboureth by that meane to take away all doubt about the yeare of the Baptiſme and Paſſion of Chriſt. And firſt he putteth a difference betweene the vſual yeare, and the Emergent yeare: which Emergent yeare, <hi>a quouis rei euentu quouis tempore anni vſualis emergit &amp; incipit, &amp; reuolutis duodecim menſibus ſolaribus finem ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, atque iterum in ſua vestigia redit, &amp; iterum atque ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum circumuoluitur, donec ea res numerari deſinit, a cuius euentu coeptum eſt numerari; vt ſolet fieri in primordijs regum &amp; imperatorum.</hi> And after he addeth: <hi>ad hoc tempus anni emergentis annos Domini dupliciter numera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, aut ſecundum Natiuitatem, aut ſecundu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aetatem &amp;c. By this Emergent yeare we account the yeare of the Lord two waies: eyther by his Natiuitie, or by his age. Whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Chriſt being borne in the end of the vſuall yeare,</hi> (he meaneth of the Romans) <hi>he had of the laſt yeare of his Natiuitie but onely 7 daies: but the firſt yeare of his age, from the 25 day of</hi> December, <hi>wherein he was borne, to that day tweluemonth, is ended in the ſecond yeare of his Natiuitie. And ſo he accompliſhed two yeares of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie, after the vſuall yeare almoſt in the firſt yeare of his age: and the ſecond yeare of his Natiuitie and the firſt of his age is all one. Whereby it commeth to paſſe that the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:15194:49"/>
yeares of Chriſtes Natiuitie are 34 and a halfe almoſt, &amp;c.</hi> Anone after, <hi>and in the 33 yeare of his age and 34 of his Natiuitie Chriſt ſuffered.</hi> Againe, <hi>therefore</hi> Iulius Caeſar <hi>being ſlayne in</hi> March, <hi>whence</hi> Auguſtus <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre is accounted, Chriſt began the firſt yeare of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie in the end of</hi> Auguſtus <hi>42 yeare. &amp;c.</hi> This diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence I thought good to alledge, becauſe it may ſerue the Hiſtorician to many good purpoſes; as namely it openeth and declareth the meaning of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſeus,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>anno Auguſti 42 prope emenſo Chriſtus natus eſt,</hi> as before I expounded it. As for the ſcruple before mentioned and moued, it doth ſomewhat ouerſhadowe it, but not cleane take it away: ſhifting it off prettily, but not ſatisfying it fully. For if we take the common and vulgar Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Chriſt to be <hi>ſecundum Natiuitatem</hi> after his Natiuitie, then indeed the ſecond yeare of Chriſt <hi>ſecundùm Natiuitatem</hi> muſt begin before the ſecond yeare of Chriſtes true Incarnation; and ſo onward the Computation <hi>ſecundum Natiuitatem</hi> will begin a quarter of a yeare before the Computation from his Incarnation: Although the firſt yeare of Chriſt <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum Natiuitatem,</hi> which contayned but 7 daies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan three quarters after the beginning of the firſt yeare of his Incarnation. But heere firſt I ſay, that in the common and vulgar Computation of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the yeare of the Lord is not taken <hi>ſecundum Natiuitatem,</hi> but <hi>ſecundum aetatem,</hi> &amp; beginneth not at the firſt day of <hi>Ianuarie,</hi> but at the 25 day of <hi>December</hi> which was the day of his Natiuitie, as appeareth by the councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> which putteth the 28 of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> and the 11 of <hi>March</hi> both in one yeare. And although the Aſtronomers, and ſome other haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:15194:50"/>
the yeare of Chriſt to the vſuall yeare of the <hi>Romanes</hi> and beginne it with the beginning thereof, that is at the firſt day of <hi>Ianuarie,</hi> being the day of Chriſtes Circumciſion, yet they doe not account thoſe 7 daies before for a yeare, but cleane caſt them away, and reckon them not at all: as <hi>Foroſemproni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſis</hi> ſheweth <hi>pag.</hi> 2. <hi>li. 4.</hi> and as the yearely Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nackes teſtifie, which after the Circumciſion keepe euer the ſame yeare of the Lord, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth, whereas otherwiſe they woulde haue a yeare more. Thirdly if it were ſo, that the common and vſuall Computation of Chriſtendome, did take the yeare of the Lord, <hi>ſecundùm Natiuitatem,</hi> yet that will not helpe the matter and cauſe in hand: becauſe <hi>Bergomas</hi> maketh but 33 yeares betweene Chriſtes Incarnation and Paſsion, and then we are in as bad caſe as we were before. For a whole yeare of the life of Chriſt is ſtill loſt: ſo that the Computation will not reach to the true <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>By this alſo you may ſee, that the dreame of <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Foroſempronienſis,</hi> was nothing but a dreame.

            <p>As thus. The Councel of <hi>Nice</hi> was holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Aera</hi> 363: add therto 3986 &amp; we ſhal find the yeare of the world 4349. Again from 363 ſubſtract 38: and you haue the yeare of Chriſt 325; adde thereto 4024; and you finde that way too the ſame yeare of the world 4349. Yet it is hard to giue a rule to reconcile the Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Euſebius</hi> and the <hi>Greekes,</hi> with this Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, becauſe he maketh new oddes almoſt in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie article. But after Chriſt there is one vniforme or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For he placeth the birth of Chriſt in the yeare of the world 5199, which is too much by 1174: and that muſt be ſubducted out of this Computation.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:15194:51"/>
But the Computation of the Emperour and Patriark in the Councel of <hi>Baſil,</hi> which couple the 6944 of the world, with the yeare of Chriſt 1435, is too much by 1484 yeares.</p>
            <p>By the like reſpect hauing a yeare of any one Aera or Computation, by this table ye may eaſily reduce it to any of the other.</p>
            <p>But in theſe concurrences due regard muſt be had what time of the yeare euery Computation begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth: otherwiſe (as <hi>Dionyſius Halycarnaſſaeus</hi> complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of <hi>Thucidides</hi> manner of Computation) it will be hard to couple them together but that there will be an oddes of one yeare. And therefore it ſhall not be amiſſe to ſet downe the ſeuerall formes and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of theſe yeares by the which the principall Computations are reckoned.</p>
            <p>Firſt the yeare of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> conſiſteth of 12 monthes, the odde hauing 30 daies, and the euen 29 whoſe names be 1 <hi>Abib</hi> or <hi>Niſan:</hi> 2 <hi>Iiar</hi> or <hi>Ziu:</hi> 3 <hi>Siuan:</hi> 4 <hi>Thamus:</hi> 5 <hi>Ab:</hi> 6 <hi>Elul:</hi> 7 <hi>Thiſri</hi> or <hi>Etha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim:</hi> 8 <hi>Marcheſuan</hi> or <hi>Bul:</hi> 9 <hi>Ciſleu:</hi> 10 <hi>Tebeth:</hi> 11 <hi>Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath:</hi> 12 <hi>Adar.</hi> And becauſe all this amounteth but to 354 daies in the common yeare: therfore to meete and match the courſe of the Sunne, they inſert in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine yeares a thirteenth month of 30 daies which they call <hi>Veadar,</hi> according to their cicle and rule of 19 yeares, wherein the 3. 6. 8. 11. 14. 17. and 19. haue the ſaid thirteenth month. And further to make vp the odde minutes, in euery fourth yeare they interca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late one day, as we doe in our leape yeare. This yeare began (as ſome are of opinion) before the departure out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> at the Autumnal Aequinoctiall: as the <hi>Arabians, Perſians,</hi> and latter <hi>Iewes</hi> begin their yeare:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:15194:51"/>
and as the Computation of the yeare for the Iubilies began. But out of doubt it is, that after the departure out of <hi>Aegypt Niſan</hi> was made the firſt month &amp; beginning of the yeare, <hi>Exod. 12.2. This month ſhalbe vnto you the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of months: euen the firſt month of the yeare.</hi> Which began at the new moone next to the vernal Aequinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. At which Aequinoctial the old Aſtronomers began their yeare: and the Church beginneth the yeare of the world. And therfore <hi>Dionyſius Exiguus</hi> to make the year of Chriſt proportionable to the yeare of the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan it at the Incarnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or Conceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which was on the vernal Aequinoctial. But in the year of the Lord 1351 for a ſpeciall cauſe before ſpoken of, it was reduced to the Natiuitie of Chriſt. And ſo there is but a weeke oddes between the Eccleſiaſtical or Church Computation of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the ciuill or imperiall Computation. For the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> begin their newe yeare at the day of Chriſtes Natiuitie, that is the 25 of <hi>December:</hi> and the Empyre beginneth their new yeare the firſt day of <hi>Ianu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie:</hi> which we in this realme and other countries too commonly call new yeares day; becauſe the late Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers begin their new yeare there: as our yearly Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manackes doe witneſſe; and <hi>Paulus Foroſempronienſis</hi> ſheweth <hi>parte 2. l. 4. The Astronomers of our time, which after the manner of the</hi> Romanes <hi>haue reduced the Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of yeares to</hi> Ianuarie, <hi>and the</hi> radices motuu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The Indictions of the Empyre begin the 8 Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendes of <hi>October;</hi> but the Pope beginneth his Indicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons three monthes after the 8 Calendes of <hi>December;</hi> that is, at the day of Chriſtes Natiuitie.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> are made by <hi>Herodotus, li. 2.</hi> and by <hi>Diodorus Siculus, li. 1.</hi> to be the inuentors and firſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the yeare.

For their yeare (after the which <hi>Nabonaſſars</hi> Aera is accounted) hath indeed 12 monthes, namely, <hi>Thoth, Phaothe, Athyr, Chiac, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi, Mechir, Phamenoth, Pharmuthi, Pachon, Paune, Epe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phi,</hi> and <hi>Meſori:</hi> all which haue 30 daies a peece, and the laſt 35: which make in all 365 daies for their yeare. But becauſe they omit the intercalation of a day in the leape yeare, it falleth out that the firſt day of their month <hi>Thoth</hi> and conſequently of their yeare, wandreth thorow all the daies of our yeare in 1460 yeares.

For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Romulus,</hi> they began the yeare at the ſommer Solſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, as it is likely, becauſe they learned their yeare of the <hi>Graecians.</hi> Yet it may be, they had both their year &amp; the beginning of it from <hi>Noach</hi> or his children, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward corrupted the ſame. Howſoeuer it be, <hi>Romulus</hi> (as <hi>Macrobius</hi> ſheweth <hi>Saturnal. li. 1.</hi>) ordayned a yeare of 304 daies, and deuided it into 10 monthes, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the firſt <hi>March</hi> in honour of his father <hi>Mars,</hi> and therewith began the yeare coupling the firſt of <hi>March</hi> with the vernal Aequinoctiall without reſpect of anie leape yeare. But <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> ſeeing this yeare goe too faſt for the courſe of the Sun, added 50 daies more, and after vpon better aduiſement he put to one day more and ſo brought them to 355, and withall added two monthes, <hi>Ianuarie</hi> and <hi>Februarie,</hi> and began the yeare with <hi>Ianuarie,</hi> as the Citie and Empyre of <hi>Rome</hi> hath done euer ſince. And becauſe all this would not ſerue, he deuiſed an intercalar month, as the <hi>Greekes</hi> had; but he cleane left out the leape yeare.

            </p>
            <p>Which variation <hi>Gregorie xiij.</hi> pretending to amend, in the yeare 1582 made an alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the yeare, and brake the courſe, which it hath euer kept ſince <hi>Iulius Caeſars</hi> time, reducing the Aequinoctials and Solſtices to the pointes, which they poſſeſſed at the Councel of <hi>Nice.</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:15194:54"/>
And this he effected, by taking 10 daies out of <hi>October</hi> 1582: ordayning for heereafter, that euery 400 yeares 3 biſſextil or leape yeares ſhould be omitted: making the quantitie of the yeare leſſe than <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> did by one hundreth thirtie third part of a day, and one third of ſuch a part. And ſo he ſaith, that Calender will laſt and ſerue till the yeare of Chriſt 5000. This is the ſumme of <hi>Gregories</hi> correction of the yeare and Calendar.</p>
            <p>How well he hath done, to make this correction, &amp; how well he hath done it, may in few wordes appeare vnto vs, if we conſider theſe fewe pointes.</p>
            <p>Firſt in remouing the Aequinoctial he condemneth the councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> who thought it not meete to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue it at all, but fixed it, where they found it, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>March, 21.</hi> as <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> left it at <hi>March. 25:</hi> and ſo <hi>Petrus Cameracenſis</hi> vrged in the councel of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and had perſwaded <hi>Iohn xxiij.</hi> if he had continued in the popedome, and of the ſame opinion was <hi>Paulus Foro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſempronienſis,</hi> in his <hi>Paulina parte, 1.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly he taketh not the right <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> marke or point. For if he would needes remoue it, why did he not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it to the originall and firſt beginning of the <hi>Iulian</hi> yeare, that is to the 25 of <hi>March,</hi> which place it had at the Natiuitie of Chriſt, a thing more memorable than the councel of <hi>Nice?</hi> But they muſt needes ſhew their mindes euen in this, how they more affect and preferre the actions of the Church than of Chriſt Ieſu. If the Aequinoctials muſt needes be fixed, and kept from varying, fixe them where they ought to be fixed, that is where they were at their Creation: or at the leaſt where they were at Chriſtes Paſſion and Reſurrection. For the right celebrating therof they pretend to be the cauſe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:15194:54"/>
of their alteration. But rather, why are they not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to runne their race and hold on their courſe, which they euer haue kept ſince the beginning? For what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie hath he, more than all the world before him, to ſet the heauens their boundes, and preſcribe lawes to the ſtarres, yea to bridle the Sunne it ſelfe, as though he held the world in his hand? Cannot he be content, that the Sunne Moone and Starres ſhall keepe their courſe, and the feſtiuall daies be ſolemniſed in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed times, as well as God himſelf was? Why doth he take vpon more than God himſelfe did in the Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Paſſouer and other ſolemnities; which being once by him appointed, continued a longer time than from the councell of <hi>Nice</hi> to <hi>Gregorie xiij.</hi> without any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the yeare? He may aſſure himſelf that if it had beene neceſſarie or meete to be done, or anie inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience had growen by the not doing of it, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe would haue altered it in that ſtrickt pedagogie of his people, who were ſo preciſely tied to the obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of daies and times.</p>
            <p>Thirdly the manner of remouing it, was cauſe of great confuſion and trouble, by taking of 10 daies out of one month at one puſh; as they did: contrarie to the wiſedome of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> who to amend the ſurpluſſage of three daies, cauſed the three next leape yeares to be omitted. And contrarie to the iudgement of his owne predicant Friar <hi>Iohannes Maria,</hi> who affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that that waye would be <hi>difficilis &amp; gignens pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationem magnam,</hi>

            <p>Fourthly for the remedie prouided for hereafter, the meanes of omitting three leape yeares in euerie 400 yeares, will not keepe the Aequinoctial at the 21 of <hi>March.</hi> For the variation of it from <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> to <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie xiij.</hi> is not agreeable to that proportion. For by his reckoning, in 133 yeares, and one third part, it goeth backe one daie. Nowe from <hi>Iulius Caeſars</hi> inſtituting of the Calendar to the yeare 1582, are 1627 yeares. In which ſumme you haue 133⅓, but 12 times beſide the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of ¼ almoſt. So that by this reckoning, at that yeare 1582 the Aequinoctiall is remoued from the 25 and 26 of <hi>March</hi> not full 12 daies and a quarter: wheras all Aſtronomers hold, that it is remoued 15 daies. So likewiſe from the councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> which was in the yeare of Chriſt 325 to that yeare 1582, there are 1257 yeares: in which ſumme we haue 133⅓ but nine times, beſide the remainder of ¼ and a little more. So that by this account the Aequinoctiall is remoued from the 21 daie of <hi>March,</hi> not much more than nine daies and a quarter: and Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> hath ſtricken out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar full 10 daies. Wherfore his Calendar muſt needs be falſe, eyther in the place of the Aequinoctiall, which is reduced to the 21 of <hi>March;</hi> or in the new quantitie of the yeare, and remedie prouided for the perpetuitie of it. And ſurely this is a notable argument of mans dulneſſe of wit, and dimneſſe of ſight euen of his ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh eies (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calleth them) in the great workes of God. For indeed, the exact courſe of the Sunne, and the iuſt quantitie of the yeare, is incomprehenſible of mans wit. Which hath bred among the beſt Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:15194:55"/>
at the leaſt 20 diuerſe opinions of the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of the yeare, all differing from this of <hi>Gregories,</hi> as you may ſee in <hi>Cenſorine de die Natali, Cap. de anno ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente,</hi> and in <hi>Picus Mirandula aduerſ. Aſtrologos. li. 9. ca. 9.</hi> where he noteth and obſerueth that <hi>Azerchel, Baten, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac, Iſraelita</hi> and ſome iunior Aſtronomers doe holde, that as the daies doe lengthen and ſhorten, ſo the yeares do likewiſe, and that in the yeare of Chriſt 1310 the yeare was at the ſhorteſt, and within a while after would begin to lengthen againe.</p>
            <p>Laſtly for the terme that this Calendar will ſerue, I take it one of the wiſeſt actes of his Holines, when as he auoucheth that his Calendar will ſerue and laſt without alteration till the yeare of Chriſt 5000. For vnleſſe the terme be long the labour is needleſſe: becauſe in a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares the variation is not ſenſible, and therefore cauſeth no inconuenience at all: in that (as himſelfe ſaith) 133 yeares and a third part make but one daies oddes. And therefore ſince the Creation the Aequino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall hath odded but 42 daies: &amp; now it would be 1463 yeares before it could get out of <hi>March,</hi> where now it is. And whether the world ſhall laſt ſo long, God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Sure we are, that it ſhall not laſt ſo long after Chriſt as it had laſted before Chriſt. For the holie Ghoſt well nigh 1600 yeares agoe ſaith, <hi>It was the endes of the world 1. Cor. 10.11. the laſt daies, Heb. 1.1. yea the laſt houre, 1. Ioh. 2.18.</hi> and therefore we muſt needes be now in the laſt minute of the laſt houre, our hourglaſſe being almoſt out. Wherefore let them that be wiſe conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope in ſetting that tearme of 5000 yeares of Chriſt, ſhew not himſelfe and his to be of the number of thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
